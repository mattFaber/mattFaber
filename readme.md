# About

Hi, Iâ€™m @mattFaber!

I'm currently running my own development company, creativly named [Faber Development](https://faberdevelopment.com), which I started in 2018.

Most of the work I've done in the past 3 years has been focused on developing serverless web applications and websites for a range of different clients.

I've also worked on quite a few professional training and elearning projects since I started my company as well.

I've worked professionally in web development since 2008 and e-learning since 2010.
