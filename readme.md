## About

Hi, I’m @mattFaber!

I'm currently running my own development company, creatively named <a href="https://faberdevelopment.com" target="_blank">Faber Development</a>, which I started back in 2018.

Most of the work I've done in the past few years has been focused on developing serverless web apps and spa's for a range of different clients.

I've also worked on quite a few professional training and elearning projects since I started my company, some as a carry over from my past employer.

I've worked professionally in web development since 2008 and e-learning since 2010.
